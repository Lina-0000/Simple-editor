The editor allows you to perform the following actions: 

When you click on the left mouse button, a point is drawn. 
When you click on the right mouse button, the trajectory drawn with the mouse is erased. 

The right arrow and left arrow keys move the cursor, the Home key moves the cursor to the beginning of the line, the End key moves the cursor to the end of the line. The Del key deletes the text to the right of the cursor, the Backspace key deletes the text to the left of the cursor. Character keys display the corresponding character on the screen. 

Esc clears the screen.
